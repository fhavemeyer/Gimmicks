Adds extra functionality for gimmick network minecraft servers.

Teams

Allows players and admins to assign team colours, player nametags appear this colour. Ideal for group fights.

HungerGames

Adds a load of commands useful for hunger games or similar events includes the following:

Fancy death messages (with the player's face)
Player spreading.
Magic Chests - chests that respawn with random content from loot table
Mute all toggle
Heal/feed all
Intro to play
Compass player tracking - track the nearest player with a right click of a compass

Installation

Put gimmicks.jar in your plugins folder
Depends on TagAPI: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tag/
Run once for config to generate
Config can be reloaded without a full reload with /gimmicks reload
Not completely /reload safe - player faces get cached on login, a reload would stop their faces showing up in death messages

Relies on the following permissions to function:

Recommend that you give gimmicks.admin and gimmicks.teams.admin to all OPs, if it's an event with fixed teams don't give the players gimmicks.teams.user
